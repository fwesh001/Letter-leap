    <h2>🎯 Objective</h2>
    <p>
        The goal is simple: you’re in a race against time to type as many real English words as you can using the letters on screen. 
        Think of it like word sprinting—every correct word gives you points, and longer words score more. 
        But here’s the twist: you only get credit for words with 3 letters or more. So no, “us” won’t cut it. 😏
    </p>
    <p>
        Just type a word, hit <strong>Enter</strong>, and boom—if it’s valid, it gets added to your score. 
        If not? You get a pop-up calling you out (nicely). The more words you find, and the smarter your word choices, 
        the higher your score. Easy to play, tough to master.
