## 🚀 About the Game

**Letter-Leap** is a word chain game where you and the AI take turns spelling words. Each word must begin with the last letter of the previous word — think fast, type faster! But there’s a twist:  

- ⏳ Beat the timer before it runs out  
- 🧠 Words must be real, unused, and long enough  
- 🎯 Minimum word length increases the longer you survive  
- 🏆 Unlock quirky achievements and brag-worthy badges  
- 🤖 Battle the AI until one of you runs out of words!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Start the game and you’ll get a random starting letter.
2. Type a valid word that starts with that letter.
3. The AI responds with its word — your turn again!
4. You gain 5 seconds for every correct word.
5. Survive, score, unlock achievements, and laugh at the ridiculous game-over quotes 😂
